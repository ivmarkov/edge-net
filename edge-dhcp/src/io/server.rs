/// Furthermore, some DHCP clients do send DHCP OFFER packets without the broadcast flag in the DHCP payload being set to true.
/// To support these clients, the socket needs to also be capable of sending packets with a broadcast IP destination address
/// - yet - with the destination *MAC* address in the Ethernet frame set to the MAC address of the DHCP client.
///
/// This is currently only possible with STD's BSD raw sockets' implementation. Unfortunately, `smoltcp` and thus `embassy-net`
/// do not have an equivalent (yet).
